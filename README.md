# Wolfenstein_3D_VR
A proof of concept demo of a Unity VR recreation of Wolfenstein 3D.
The game was made for my bachelor's degree in 2022 at Poitehnica University of Bucharest. 
Its purpose is to showcase the adaptation of an old idea using modern technologies with an intriguing spin on it. 
Moreover, it was a test on my ability to learn new technologies and how to work in unfamiliar environments, as it was made with no previous experience with game development, Unity, or VR.
